Hey there,

If you've ever needed to pass multiple children to a React component, but wanted more control over their layout (i.e., not all bunched together), give today's post a read.

This "slots" pattern is also useful for passing props through multiple levels, and can help you avoid having to reach for more complex things like Context or Redux just to get your data where it needs to be.

Read it here: Pass Multiple Children to a React Component with Slots

Cheers,
